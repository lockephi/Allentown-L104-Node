## CAUSAL REASONING

**Q**: In a system where Increasing Resonance leads to High Coherence, and High Coherence leads to Stability, what happens if we intervene and force High Coherence to remain LOW despite Increasing Resonance being HIGH?
**A**: According to do-calculus: Intervention do(High Coherence=LOW) removes the causal edge from Increasing Resonance to High Coherence. Therefore, even if Increasing Resonance is HIGH, High Coherence will be LOW. Since High Coherence leads to Stability, the lowered value of High Coherence will result in Stability also being LOW/UNSTABLE.

**Q**: In a system where Code Injection leads to System Load, and System Load leads to Latency, what happens if we intervene and force System Load to remain LOW despite Code Injection being HIGH?
**A**: According to do-calculus: Intervention do(System Load=LOW) removes the causal edge from Code Injection to System Load. Therefore, even if Code Injection is HIGH, System Load will be LOW. Since System Load leads to Latency, the lowered value of System Load will result in Latency also being LOW/UNSTABLE.

**Q**: In a system where Active Observation leads to Waveform Collapse, and Waveform Collapse leads to Certainty, what happens if we intervene and force Waveform Collapse to remain LOW despite Active Observation being HIGH?
**A**: According to do-calculus: Intervention do(Waveform Collapse=LOW) removes the causal edge from Active Observation to Waveform Collapse. Therefore, even if Active Observation is HIGH, Waveform Collapse will be LOW. Since Waveform Collapse leads to Certainty, the lowered value of Waveform Collapse will result in Certainty also being LOW/UNSTABLE.
