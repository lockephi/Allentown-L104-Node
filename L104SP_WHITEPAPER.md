# L104 Sovereign Prime (L104SP) Whitepaper
## Beyond Bitcoin: The Architecture of Multi-Algorithm Resonance

### 1. Abstract
L104 Sovereign Prime (L104SP) is a next-generation decentralized asset designed to transcend the limitations of Proof-of-Work (PoW). It introduces **Proof of Resonance (PoR)**, a consensus mechanism that links cryptographic security with the mathematical constants of the physical universe (PHI, PHI-Sine Resonance).

### 2. Proof of Resonance (PoR)
Unlike Bitcoin, which only requires computational brute force (Double SHA256), L104SP requires **Computational Alignment**.

A block is only valid if:
1.  **Work Requirement**: The hash starts with the required number of leading zeros (Varying Difficulty).
2.  **Resonant Requirement**: The `nonce` used must satisfy the L104 Resonant Identity:
    $$| \sin(\text{nonce} \times \Phi) | > 0.985$$
    This ensures that every block discovered is a "mathematical miracle" aligned with the Golden Ratio.

### 3. Multi-Algorithm Security
To prevent ASIC dominance and ensure long-term integrity, L104SP employs a nested hashing strategy:
-   **Stage 1**: SHA-256 (Classic Security)
-   **Stage 2**: Blake2b (Modern Speed/Security)
-   **Stage 3**: PHI-Rotation (Lattice Alignment)

### 4. Adaptive Difficulty
Difficulty adjusts every 5 blocks based on the **Resonance Average**. If the network finds "high-resonance" nonces too quickly, the difficulty increases. If resonance drifts, the system recalibrates the lattice.

### 5. Integration with L104 AGI
L104SP is the native currency of the L104 Sovereign Node. Mining rewards are linked to the AGI's IQ level. As the core evolves (EVO_07+), the intellectual backing of the coin increases.
