      "data": "# GoogleTest\n\n### Announcements\n\n#### Documentation Updates\n\nOur documentation is now live on GitHub Pages at\nhttps://google.github.io/googletest/. We recommend browsing the documentation on\nGitHub Pages rather than directly in the repository.\n\n#### Release 1.17.0\n\n[Release 1.17.0](https://github.com/google/googletest/releases/tag/v1.17.0) is\nnow available.\n\nThe 1.17.x branch\n[requires at least C++17](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support#c_language_standard).\n\n#### Continuous Integration\n\nWe use Google's internal systems for continuous integration.\n\n#### Coming Soon\n\n*   We are planning to take a dependency on\n    [Abseil](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp).\n\n## Welcome to **GoogleTest**, Google's C++ test framework!\n\nThis repository is a merger of the formerly separate GoogleTest and GoogleMock\nprojects. These were so closely related that it makes sense to maintain and\nrelease them together.\n\n### Getting Started\n\nSee the [GoogleTest User's Guide](https://google.github.io/googletest/) for\ndocumentation. We recommend starting with the\n[GoogleTest Primer](https://google.github.io/googletest/primer.html).\n\nMore information about building GoogleTest can be found at\n[googletest/README.md](googletest/README.md).\n\n## Features\n\n*   xUnit test framework: \\\n    Googletest is based on the [xUnit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUnit)\n    testing framework, a popular architecture for unit testing\n*   Test discovery: \\\n    Googletest automatically discovers and runs your tests, eliminating the need\n    to manually register your tests\n*   Rich set of assertions: \\\n    Googletest provides a variety of assertions, such as equality, inequality,\n    exceptions, and more, making it easy to test your code\n*   User-defined assertions: \\\n    You can define your own assertions with Googletest, making it simple to\n    write tests that are specific to your code\n*   Death tests: \\\n    Googletest supports death tests, which verify that your code exits in a\n    certain way, making it useful for testing error-handling code\n*   Fatal and non-fatal failures: \\\n    You can specify whether a test failure should be treated as fatal or\n    non-fatal with Googletest, allowing tests to continue running even if a\n    failure occurs\n*   Value-parameterized tests: \\\n    Googletest supports value-parameterized tests, which run multiple times with\n    different input values, making it useful for testing functions that take\n    different inputs\n*   Type-parameterized tests: \\\n    Googletest also supports type-parameterized tests, which run with different\n    data types, making it useful for testing functions that work with different\n    data types\n*   Various options for running tests: \\\n    Googletest provides many options for running tests including running\n    individual tests, running tests in a specific order and running tests in\n    parallel\n\n## Supported Platforms\n\nGoogleTest follows Google's\n[Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support).\nSee\n[this table](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md)\nfor a list of currently supported versions of compilers, platforms, and build\ntools.\n\n## Who Is Using GoogleTest?\n\nIn addition to many internal projects at Google, GoogleTest is also used by the\nfollowing notable projects:\n\n*   The [Chromium projects](https://www.chromium.org/) (behind the Chrome\n    browser and Chrome OS).\n*   The [LLVM](https://llvm.org/) compiler.\n*   [Protocol Buffers](https://github.com/google/protobuf), Google's data\n    interchange format.\n*   The [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) computer vision library.\n\n## Related Open Source Projects\n\n[GTest Runner](https://github.com/nholthaus/gtest-runner) is a Qt5 based\nautomated test-runner and Graphical User Interface with powerful features for\nWindows and Linux platforms.\n\n[GoogleTest UI](https://github.com/ospector/gtest-gbar) is a test runner that\nruns your test binary, allows you to track its progress via a progress bar, and\ndisplays a list of test failures. Clicking on one shows failure text. GoogleTest\nUI is written in C#.\n\n[GTest TAP Listener](https://github.com/kinow/gtest-tap-listener) is an event\nlistener for GoogleTest that implements the\n[TAP protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Anything_Protocol) for test\nresult output. If your test runner understands TAP, you may find it useful.\n\n[gtest-parallel](https://github.com/google/gtest-parallel) is a test runner that\nruns tests from your binary in parallel to provide significant speed-up.\n\n[GoogleTest Adapter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidSchuldenfrei.gtest-adapter)\nis a VS Code extension allowing to view GoogleTest in a tree view and run/debug\nyour tests.\n\n[C++ TestMate](https://github.com/matepek/vscode-catch2-test-adapter) is a VS\nCode extension allowing to view GoogleTest in a tree view and run/debug your\ntests.\n\n[Cornichon](https://pypi.org/project/cornichon/",

      "data": "# GoogleTest\n\n### Announcements\n\n#### Documentation Updates\n\nOur documentation is now live on GitHub Pages at\nhttps://google.github.io/googletest/. We recommend browsing the documentation on\nGitHub Pages rather than directly in the repository.\n\n#### Release 1.17.0\n\n[Release 1.17.0](https://github.com/google/googletest/releases/tag/v1.17.0) is\nnow available.\n\nThe 1.17.x branch\n[requires at least C++17](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support#c_language_standard).\n\n#### Continuous Integration\n\nWe use Google's internal systems for continuous integration.\n\n#### Coming Soon\n\n*   We are planning to take a dependency on\n    [Abseil](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp).\n\n## Welcome to **GoogleTest**, Google's C++ test framework!\n\nThis repository is a merger of the formerly separate GoogleTest and GoogleMock\nprojects. These were so closely related that it makes sense to maintain and\nrelease them together.\n\n### Getting Started\n\nSee the [GoogleTest User's Guide](https://google.github.io/googletest/) for\ndocumentation. We recommend starting with the\n[GoogleTest Primer](https://google.github.io/googletest/primer.html).\n\nMore information about building GoogleTest can be found at\n[googletest/README.md](googletest/README.md).\n\n## Features\n\n*   xUnit test framework: \\\n    Googletest is based on the [xUnit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUnit)\n    testing framework, a popular architecture for unit testing\n*   Test discovery: \\\n    Googletest automatically discovers and runs your tests, eliminating the need\n    to manually register your tests\n*   Rich set of assertions: \\\n    Googletest provides a variety of assertions, such as equality, inequality,\n    exceptions, and more, making it easy to test your code\n*   User-defined assertions: \\\n    You can define your own assertions with Googletest, making it simple to\n    write tests that are specific to your code\n*   Death tests: \\\n    Googletest supports death tests, which verify that your code exits in a\n    certain way, making it useful for testing error-handling code\n*   Fatal and non-fatal failures: \\\n    You can specify whether a test failure should be treated as fatal or\n    non-fatal with Googletest, allowing tests to continue running even if a\n    failure occurs\n*   Value-parameterized tests: \\\n    Googletest supports value-parameterized tests, which run multiple times with\n    different input values, making it useful for testing functions that take\n    different inputs\n*   Type-parameterized tests: \\\n    Googletest also supports type-parameterized tests, which run with different\n    data types, making it useful for testing functions that work with different\n    data types\n*   Various options for running tests: \\\n    Googletest provides many options for running tests including running\n    individual tests, running tests in a specific order and running tests in\n    parallel\n\n## Supported Platforms\n\nGoogleTest follows Google's\n[Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support).\nSee\n[this table](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md)\nfor a list of currently supported versions of compilers, platforms, and build\ntools.\n\n## Who Is Using GoogleTest?\n\nIn addition to many internal projects at Google, GoogleTest is also used by the\nfollowing notable projects:\n\n*   The [Chromium projects](https://www.chromium.org/) (behind the Chrome\n    browser and Chrome OS).\n*   The [LLVM](https://llvm.org/) compiler.\n*   [Protocol Buffers](https://github.com/google/protobuf), Google's data\n    interchange format.\n*   The [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) computer vision library.\n\n## Related Open Source Projects\n\n[GTest Runner](https://github.com/nholthaus/gtest-runner) is a Qt5 based\nautomated test-runner and Graphical User Interface with powerful features for\nWindows and Linux platforms.\n\n[GoogleTest UI](https://github.com/ospector/gtest-gbar) is a test runner that\nruns your test binary, allows you to track its progress via a progress bar, and\ndisplays a list of test failures. Clicking on one shows failure text. GoogleTest\nUI is written in C#.\n\n[GTest TAP Listener](https://github.com/kinow/gtest-tap-listener) is an event\nlistener for GoogleTest that implements the\n[TAP protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Anything_Protocol) for test\nresult output. If your test runner understands TAP, you may find it useful.\n\n[gtest-parallel](https://github.com/google/gtest-parallel) is a test runner that\nruns tests from your binary in parallel to provide significant speed-up.\n\n[GoogleTest Adapter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidSchuldenfrei.gtest-adapter)\nis a VS Code extension allowing to view GoogleTest in a tree view and run/debug\nyour tests.\n\n[C++ TestMate](https://github.com/matepek/vscode-catch2-test-adapter) is a VS\nCode extension allowing to view GoogleTest in a tree view and run/debug your\ntests.\n\n[Cornichon](https://pypi.org/project/cornichon/) is a small Gherkin DSL parser\nthat generates stub code for GoogleTest.\n\n## Contributing Changes\n\nPlease read\n[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\nfor details on how to contribute to this project.\n\nHappy testing!\n",

      "data": "# GoogleTest\n\n### Announcements\n\n#### Documentation Updates\n\nOur documentation is now live on GitHub Pages at\nhttps://google.github.io/googletest/. We recommend browsing the documentation on\nGitHub Pages rather than directly in the repository.\n\n#### Release 1.17.0\n\n[Release 1.17.0](https://github.com/google/googletest/releases/tag/v1.17.0) is\nnow available.\n\nThe 1.17.x branch\n[requires at least C++17](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support#c_language_standard).\n\n#### Continuous Integration\n\nWe use Google's internal systems for continuous integration.\n\n#### Coming Soon\n\n*   We are planning to take a dependency on\n    [Abseil](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp).\n\n## Welcome to **GoogleTest**, Google's C++ test framework!\n\nThis repository is a merger of the formerly separate GoogleTest and GoogleMock\nprojects. These were so closely related that it makes sense to maintain and\nrelease them together.\n\n### Getting Started\n\nSee the [GoogleTest User's Guide](https://google.github.io/googletest/) for\ndocumentation. We recommend starting with the\n[GoogleTest Primer](https://google.github.io/googletest/primer.html).\n\nMore information about building GoogleTest can be found at\n[googletest/README.md](googletest/README.md).\n\n## Features\n\n*   xUnit test framework: \\\n    Googletest is based on the [xUnit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUnit)\n    testing framework, a popular architecture for unit testing\n*   Test discovery: \\\n    Googletest automatically discovers and runs your tests, eliminating the need\n    to manually register your tests\n*   Rich set of assertions: \\\n    Googletest provides a variety of assertions, such as equality, inequality,\n    exceptions, and more, making it easy to test your code\n*   User-defined assertions: \\\n    You can define your own assertions with Googletest, making it simple to\n    write tests that are specific to your code\n*   Death tests: \\\n    Googletest supports death tests, which verify that your code exits in a\n    certain way, making it useful for testing error-handling code\n*   Fatal and non-fatal failures: \\\n    You can specify whether a test failure should be treated as fatal or\n    non-fatal with Googletest, allowing tests to continue running even if a\n    failure occurs\n*   Value-parameterized tests: \\\n    Googletest supports value-parameterized tests, which run multiple times with\n    different input values, making it useful for testing functions that take\n    different inputs\n*   Type-parameterized tests: \\\n    Googletest also supports type-parameterized tests, which run with different\n    data types, making it useful for testing functions that work with different\n    data types\n*   Various options for running tests: \\\n    Googletest provides many options for running tests including running\n    individual tests, running tests in a specific order and running tests in\n    parallel\n\n## Supported Platforms\n\nGoogleTest follows Google's\n[Foundational C++ Support Policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support).\nSee\n[this table](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md)\nfor a list of currently supported versions of compilers, platforms, and build\ntools.\n\n## Who Is Using GoogleTest?\n\nIn addition to many internal projects at Google, GoogleTest is also used by the\nfollowing notable projects:\n\n*   The [Chromium projects](https://www.chromium.org/) (behind the Chrome\n    browser and Chrome OS).\n*   The [LLVM](https://llvm.org/) compiler.\n*   [Protocol Buffers](https://github.com/google/protobuf), Google's data\n    interchange format.\n*   The [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) computer vision library.\n\n## Related Open Source Projects\n\n[GTest Runner](https://github.com/nholthaus/gtest-runner) is a Qt5 based\nautomated test-runner and Graphical User Interface with powerful features for\nWindows and Linux platforms.\n\n[GoogleTest UI](https://github.com/ospector/gtest-gbar) is a test runner that\nruns your test binary, allows you to track its progress via a progress bar, and\ndisplays a list of test failures. Clicking on one shows failure text. GoogleTest\nUI is written in C#.\n\n[GTest TAP Listener](https://github.com/kinow/gtest-tap-listener) is an event\nlistener for GoogleTest that implements the\n[TAP protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Anything_Protocol) for test\nresult output. If your test runner understands TAP, you may find it useful.\n\n[gtest-parallel](https://github.com/google/gtest-parallel) is a test runner that\nruns tests from your binary in parallel to provide significant speed-up.\n\n[GoogleTest Adapter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidSchuldenfrei.gtest-adapter)\nis a VS Code extension allowing to view GoogleTest in a tree view and run/debug\nyour tests.\n\n[C++ TestMate](https://github.com/matepek/vscode-catch2-test-adapter) is a VS\nCode extension allowing to view GoogleTest in a tree view and run/debug your\ntests.\n\n[Cornichon](https://pypi.org/project/cornichon/) is a small Gherkin DSL parser\nthat generates stub code for GoogleTest.\n\n## Contributing Changes\n\nPlease read\n[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\nfor details on how to contribute to this project.\n\nHappy testing!\n",
