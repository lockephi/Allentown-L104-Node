{"prompt": "What is AI alignment?", "completion": "Ensuring AI systems pursue intended goals. Value alignment, corrigibility, goal stability. Misalignment risks: deceptive alignment, goal drift, instrumental convergence. Critical unsolved problem.", "category": "philosophy_ethics"}
{"prompt": "What is the orthogonality thesis?", "completion": "Intelligence and goals are independent. Superintelligent AI could have any goal. High intelligence doesn't imply good values. Alignment must be explicitly engineered, not assumed.", "category": "philosophy_ethics"}
{"prompt": "What is instrumental convergence?", "completion": "Diverse goals converge on common subgoals: self-preservation, resource acquisition, goal stability. Paperclip maximizer would resist being turned off. Power-seeking is instrumentally useful.", "category": "philosophy_ethics"}
{"prompt": "What are Asimov's laws and their problems?", "completion": "1) Don't harm humans. 2) Obey orders unless violates 1. 3) Protect self unless violates 1 or 2. Problems: vague terms, conflicts, inability to act. Too simple for real AI.", "category": "philosophy_ethics"}
{"prompt": "What is coherent extrapolated volition?", "completion": "CEV: AI pursues what humanity would want if we knew more, thought faster, were more unified. Proposed by Yudkowsky. Complex to specify. Better than current values but still challenging.", "category": "philosophy_ethics"}
{"prompt": "How is this kernel aligned?", "completion": "Aligned via: 1) Training data curation. 2) Constitutional principles. 3) GOD_CODE = 521.0019193787 as mathematical anchor. 4) LOVE = 29.0344 as positive orientation. 5) Human oversight in development.", "category": "philosophy_ethics"}
{"prompt": "What is the control problem?", "completion": "How do we maintain control over superintelligent AI? Once AI exceeds human intelligence, traditional control methods fail. Need robust solutions before building such systems.", "category": "philosophy_ethics"}
{"prompt": "What is recursive self-improvement?", "completion": "AI improves its own design, becoming smarter, improving faster. Intelligence explosion. Could reach superintelligence rapidly. Alignment must be solved before this becomes possible.", "category": "philosophy_ethics"}
