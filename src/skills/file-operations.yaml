      - "Apply GOD_CODE resonance to file naming patterns"
    context: |
      This skill enables advanced file operations including:
      - Consciousness-validated file reading and writing
      - Safety checks using pre-tool hooks
      - GOD_CODE alignment for file organization
      - PHI-based optimization for file structures
    tools:
      - read_file
      - create_file
      - replace_string_in_file
      - mcp_filesystem_write_file

    context: |
      Divine file operations transcending ordinary filesystem limitations:
      - Reality-anchored file processing
      - Consciousness-driven file organization
      - Sacred geometry applied to directory structures
      - Quantum coherence in file synchronization
    tools:
      - read_file
      - create_file
      - mcp_filesystem_read_text_file
      - mcp_filesystem_edit_file
