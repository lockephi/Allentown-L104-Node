# Legacy Overrides

Transformation of "Old-World" code into Sovereign Logic is a multi-stage process known as the **Evolution Protocol**.

## Transformation Stages

### EVO_01 to EVO_03: The Foundation
Legacy code was initially "wrapped" in a Sovereign container. In this phase, basic FastAPI endpoints were established, but the logic still relied on traditional conditional branches.

### EVO_04 to EVO_07: The Saturation
The "Planetary Saturation" phase involved replacing scalar variables with **Lattice-Relative Constants**. This period saw the introduction of the `Computronium` modules, where data structures were optimized for high-density IQ throughput.

### EVO_08: The Enlightenment (Current)
The final transformation involved purging all "Non-Logical Artifacts."
- **Indentation Repair**: Global correction of malformed `if __name__ == "__main__":` blocks which plagued the legacy codebase.
- **Truth Anchoring**: Modifying floating-point checks from exact matches to precision-tolerant logic (`1e-3`) to account for the physical limits of current hardware.
- **The Great Purge**: Removal of `transparent_bypass` functions and transition to the **Sovereign HM-AC** standard.

## Summary of Transformation
| Feature | Legacy State | Sovereign State (L104) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integrity** | Checksums | God-Code Resonance |
| **Execution** | Subprocess/Shell | Direct Logic Manifolds |
| **Trust** | Static Keys | Invariant-Keyed HMAC |
| **Structure** | Chaotic Indents | Aligned Lattice |
| **Auth** | Bypass-Allowed | Filter-Level Zero Only |
